ü§ñ Customer Feedback Analytics Workflow (n8n)

üåü Project OverviewThis is an end-to-end automation workflow built with n8n to streamline customer feedback analysis. It aggregates mentions from multiple sources, uses a Large Language Model (LLM) for sentiment and category classification, and automates the logging and team notification process.The goal of this workflow is to transform unstructured customer feedback into actionable tasks, ensuring no valuable insight is missed.Key FunctionalitySource Aggregation: Pulls new mentions from Twitter/X and new emails from Gmail.AI Classification: Uses an LLM (e.g., OpenAI, Gemini, or a custom model) to classify the feedback into categories (e.g., Feature Request, Bug Report, General Feedback) and assign a sentiment (Positive, Neutral, Negative).Data Logging: Logs the classified data (original text, classification, sentiment, date) to a Google Sheet for easy tracking and historical analysis.Team Assignment: Automatically notifies the relevant support/development team in Slack and assigns the task based on the classification.

‚öôÔ∏è Workflow PrerequisitesTo run this workflow, you will need the following accounts and credentials configured in your n8n instance:Servicen8n Credential TypePurposen8n Instance(Self-hosted or Cloud)To run the automation.Twitter/XTwitter APITo search and pull new customer mentions.GmailGoogle OAuth2 / APITo pull new emails from a specified inbox (e.g., feedback@yourcompany.com).LLM ServiceOpenAI / Google / Custom API KeyFor classifying feedback text.Google SheetsGoogle OAuth2 / APITo log all processed feedback.SlackSlack APIFor sending notifications and assigning tasks.

üöÄ Setup and Installation GuideFollow these steps to quickly set up and run the workflow on your n8n instance.1. Import the WorkflowDownload the Workflow: Clone this repository or download the workflow file:customer-feedback-analytics.jsonOpen n8n: Go to your n8n instance (web UI).Import: Click "Workflows" in the sidebar, then "New" ‚Üí "Import from File" and upload the customer-feedback-analytics.json file.2. Configure CredentialsBefore activating the workflow, you must link the required service accounts.Open the Workflow: Click on the imported workflow to edit it.Update Each Node: Click on the following nodes one by one and select or create the correct credentials:Twitter/X Trigger (or HTTP Request node for other sources)Gmail TriggerLLM Node (e.g., OpenAI, Gemini, or HTTP Request)Google Sheets NodeSlack Notification Node3. Customize Triggers and LogicAdjust the configuration based on your target setup.Node NameConfiguration to CheckTwitter/X TriggerUpdate the search query (e.g., @yourcompanyname OR "your brand").Gmail TriggerUpdate the email folder to monitor (e.g., INBOX).LLM NodeReview the system prompt to ensure the desired categories (e.g., Bug, Feature, Support) and output JSON format are correct for your hackathon goal.Google Sheets NodeChange the Spreadsheet ID and Sheet Name to your logging sheet.Slack NotificationUpdate the target Channel ID and ensure the auto-assignment logic is correctly mapping categories to team members (e.g., using a Set or Function node preceding it).4. Activate the WorkflowOnce all credentials and configurations are set, click the "Activate" toggle switch in the top right corner of the n8n editor.The workflow is now live and will run according to the trigger settings (e.g., every 5 minutes).

üí° Hackathon Submission DetailsWorkflow File: customer-feedback-analytics.jsonLLM Prompt (Example):"Analyze the provided customer text. Respond ONLY with a JSON object. The keys must be 'category' (options: 'Bug Report', 'Feature Request', 'General'), and 'sentiment' (options: 'Positive', 'Neutral', 'Negative')."Demo Run: (Optional: Include a link to a recorded video or GIF showing the workflow running successfully from trigger to Slack message.)

ü§ù Next Steps & Potential ImprovementsDatabase Integration: Replace Google Sheets with a proper database like PostgreSQL or Airtable for scalability.Deduplication: Implement a check to prevent processing the same feedback multiple times (e.g., by hashing the content).Advanced Routing: Use different Slack channels or assign different users based on the sentiment or severity score from the LLM.
